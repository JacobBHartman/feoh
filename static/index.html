					<h3>Under Construction</h3>
					<p>I am leaving this space blank. The reason there are 5 sections colored Google style was for me to easily visualize my flexbox settings. I will put something here and in the other sections when it suits me.</p>

					<h3>What is the function of this site?</h3>
					<p>The point of this site is to act as a central point for a self-hosted Wiki, Blog, Store, Demo Applications, links to other sites, for friends, family, business associates, and community. It is not meant to be good-looking as I am not a frontend engineer, I specialize in DevOps tools.</p>
					<h3>How is this site deployed?</h3>
					<p>This site is deployed on AWS. To save costs, my Jenkins instance is served on the same EC2 as the containers it deploys. I have one container for each service: a webserver/reverse-proxy, Mediawiki, a Wiki DB, Wordpress and a WP DB. Due to the personal nature of the site, I have made decisions to cut costs where I otherwise wouldn't for a production infrastructure. Upon running "terraform apply", the EC2 begins a startup script that installs Ansible and runs a playbook. The playbook contains all configurations I need to run the infrastructure incl. Docker.</p>
