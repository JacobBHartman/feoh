I ran into an issue with yarn getting hung up on an integrity check. Apparently this check is no longer necessary

I looked into an official rails image bt it was deprecated in favor of the official ruby image.

I started using Issues as my to-do manager. I'd like to use the full suite of github features.

I worked on this for about 3 hours.

The app currently works by freshly cloning the repo and the container builds from the repo's file instead of generating a new rails app each time a container starts.

I clarified the purposes and goals of this project as well as invited some friends to check it out.

I should start using branching now that I have the bare bones set up.

I read that its good to not install vim into your container to reduce resource load.
