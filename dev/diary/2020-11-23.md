### October 22nd, 2020
I've been building out the infra, this is day 3 of that process. I now have a small-scale terraform, small-scale ansible, a docker-compose file, jenkins, and AWS.

I can now iterate on the app. There are still plenty of things to do such as HTTP(S).

Right now I will get the Github issues set up and the README setup.
